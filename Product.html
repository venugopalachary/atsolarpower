                <p>The Solar systems can be classified into 3 different categories based on their grid-connectivity. They are on-grid solar, off-grid solar 
                    and hybrid systems which are a combination of both. On grid solar power system is a solar power generation system where it is 
                    connected to the utility grid. The electricity produced by the system is routed to the grid from where it is used to run the various 
                    appliances. The excess power at any point of time is transmitted back to the grid.</p>
                <p>An on-grid solar system is much more attractive than an off-grid system. In an on-grid solar system, the solar power is produced only 
                    when the grid is available. The power supply gets completely cut-off in case of the grid outage. Hence, one needs to depend on 
                    back-ups such as DG sets for emergency power supply. The power shut down happens, mostly in case of safety and technical 
                    reasons.

                    <h3 class="fw-semibold text-secondary">How does on grid solar power system works?</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">This system works in two-ways — the supply of electricity can flow from the grid to which it is connected to the user’s 
                        home and from the user’s home to the grid. This feature makes the on-grid solar system affordable and highly 
                        useful. The solar panels, installed on the user’s home are ‘tied’ to the grid. The solar panels convert sunlight into 
                        electric energy, which is Direct Current (DC). This current is then sent to an inverter. The solar inverter then converts 
                        the DC to Alternating Current (AC), thus making it power the electrical items. This electricity is then routed to the grid 
                        where it is supplied for day to day use. The grid tied inverter additionally regulates the amount and voltage of 
                        electricity fed to the household since all the power generated is mostly much more than a home needs or can 
                        handle. An important feature is the net meter. It is a device that records the energy supplied to the grid and the 
                        energy consumed. At the end of each month, the outstanding is recorded and the consumer is provided with a bill. 
                        This ‘converted’power supply is then used by homes through the main electricity distribution panel.

                        consumer has to pay only for the surplus

                    <p>The bill generated on a monthly basis 
                        determines whether the consumer has 
                        any payments to be made. However, at 
                        the same time if the consumer utilizes less 
                        electricity, the excess is fed back in the 
                        grid.

        <p>Solar isn’t just for big companies anymore. Businesses of all sizes can capitalize on the many benefits of adding solar power. Solar 
            energy has become a strategic decision that has proven to have numerous benefits for your business.

                <p class="fw-bold">1. Solar power gives you a great return on investment</p>
                <p>When thinking about switching your commercial building to 
                    solar power, consider it an investment, not an expense. The 
                    return on investment you get from solar power often exceeds 
                    that of most other investments in terms of the money your 
                    business saves over the years.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">2. Reduces your operating costs</p>
                <p>Once your commercial solar panels are paid off, they will 
                    reduce the operating expenses of your business, which will 
                    cascade through your business’ balance sheet. Businesses 
                    will find that their cost to install their solar project will more 
                    than pay for itself over the lifespan of the solar system.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-lg-4 p-3">
                <p class="fw-bold">3. Control future energy bills</p>
                <p>Predicting operating costs can be difficult since you often don’t 
                    know what the future will bring. But predicting your electric bill 
                    becomes pretty easy once you add solar panels. Instead of 
                    facing unpredictable and wildly fluctuating energy bills, you’ll 
                    know what to expect each month with a commercial solar 
                    panel system that dramatically reduces your energy costs. 
                    Your budgeting just got easier because you won’t have to 
                    worry about rising energy prices.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">4. Increase your property value</p>
                <p>Homes and commercial buildings that have solar panels can 
                    have higher property values and sell faster than those that 
                    don’t, per multiple studies. And that is not likely to change. 
                    With the solar revolution gaining steam, adding commercial 
                    solar panels figures to make your building more desirable. If 
                    you have lower electric bills, that’s a boon for any business 
                    owner.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">5. Tax credits and bonus depreciation</p>
                <p>When you install commercial solar panels, you benefit from 
                    the (ITC), and aslo bonus depreciation available, businesses 
                    can take an immediate first-year deduction on their solar 
                    installations.
                    </p>
                <p class="fw-bold">6. Solar panels are more affordable than ever</p>
                <p>Solar panel installation costs have fallen more than 70 percent 
                    over the last decade. This means the price of adding solar 
                    panels also has fallen. </p>
                <p class="fw-bold">7. Improves your cash flow</p>
                <p>Once you have your commercial solar panels installed and 
                    hooked up to the energy grid, you start to save with lower 
                    energy bills each month. When less money goes to the power 
                    company, you’ll have more cash on hand once your panels are paid off.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-lg-4 p-3">
                <p class="fw-bold">8. Improves your brand with a greener image</p>
                <p>One of the great things about commercial solar panels is how 
                    you can market your commitment to clean energy to your 
                    customers. This sends a positive message about your 
                    dedication to sustainability and the environment. Every time 
                    your employees, customers, shareholders, neighbors and 
                    others know that you’re going green or see the panels for 
                    themselves, you’ll be making a great impression. Going solar 
                    not only helps protect the environment, but it also can affect 
                    how everyone in your community views your company.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">9. High reliability and low maintenance</p>
                <p>Commercial solar panels are virtually maintenance-free and 
                    noiseless. In most cases, the structure of commercial 
                    buildings makes them easily accessible. The solar cells are 
                    encased in tempered, protective glass, framed by non corrosive aluminum. They are built to be exposed to the 
                    elements and can withstand rain, hail, wind, and snow – just 
                    about any weather-related threat you can think of.
                    In general, the photovoltaic cells that make up the solar panels 
                    very rarely break down. Even if they do, solar panels come 
                    with a 25-year Performance warranty, which means that once 
                    you add solar panels to your commercial building, you will 
                    generate your own clean electricity for at least 25 years or 
                    more, from a system that is just as functional and probably 
                    more reliable than the utility company.</p>
